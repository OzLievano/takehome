How to tackle: 

- read assignment and rewrite into notes.txt into own words
- review snowflake documentation - use sample code to quickly establish connection
- establish connection and print out 'Successfully connected' 
- once establish connection - start with 'list' all schemas
   - keep all functions defined in single module then we will 
    break into multiple files. 
- We will need a routes file , queries file , connection file and we can 
add a config file to call our env files easily.
- Before modularizing files. verify that each query is returning data and returning 
expected data.
- manually pass in schema name, table names into methods and see if data is returned
- once verifying data - google and chatgpt Flask. set up server.
- Move queries inside of 'main' module and create a queries module.
- Create routes file using Flask documentation - define routes and call methods 
that were written within queries.py
- verify that endpoints are returning data after running 'flask run' from CLI
